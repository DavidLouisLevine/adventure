# adventure

The project was inspired by the BASIC computer game "C.I.A. Adventure", written by Hugh Lampert in 1980, and by a tiny four-room adventure world used in a reinforcement learning project by MIT's summer 2019 6.86x machine learning course.

This project is intended to implement:
- A full-fidelity python version of the entire C.I.A. adventure game
- A reinforcement learning framework for solving the game
- A modified original game that reads in a command script, allows further commands to be entered, and writes out a new command script and a text log of all game interactions

For quality control, the Python game can be driven by the log file generated by the modified original game. It reports any discrepancies between the log file and the current game's output.

Current status:
- The python game runs but only about 20% of the interactions have been tested
- The reinforcement learning framework is barely started
- The modified original game is fully functional

To run:
Run the cia\cia_game file.
