# C.I.A Adventure

This folder contains the original C.I.A. Adventure game written by Hugh Lampert around 1982 and
some variations of the game can be used for automating game play or to support porting the game.

To run any of the .bas files, install and run a DOS emulator such as DOSBox (tested with version 0.74),
`mount` a drive (see DOSBox instructions), <code>cd</code> to this folder, and enter <code>BASICA \<file\>.bas</code>

There's also a python-based cross-platform multi-flavor GW-BASIC emulator: http://robhagemans.github.io/pcbasic/doc/2.0/PC-BASIC_documentation.pdf 

Hint: to exit `BASICA`, use the `SYSTEM` command. To rerun, use `RUN`

It's easy to find the full documentation for IBM PC Basic and other GW-BASIC flavors online.
